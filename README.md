This is a repo to log all the Py code I write in order to solve ProjectEuler.net problems.

Techniques used - Some math formulae. Many Brute-force (Elegance required? One time thing ille?)

The amount of code currently on the repo is not equal to the number of problems I've solved on the site because 
I've begun logging code fairly recently and I need to rewrite the code for the rest if those numbers are to be equal.

Rest assured, going forward, I will be logging each and every one of my solutions.

Update - May 28 2017
Current status on ProjectEuler - 45 problems solved. 

Current code status on Github  - 22 problems logged with code.
