This is a repo to log all the Py code I write in order to solve ProjectEuler.net problems.

The amount of code currently on the repo is not equal to the number of problems I've solved on the site because 
I've begun logging code fairly recently and I need to rewrite the code for the rest if those numbers are to be equal.

Rest assured, going forward, I will be logging each and every one of my solutions.


Current status on ProjectEuler - 32 problems solved. 

Current code status on Github - 11 problems logged with code.
