So, so far this has been a solo effort and I will continue to add my solutions to this repo as and when I solve more problems on Project Euler. But if you have suggestions or different approaches (and God knows this repo could use them) to make the solution-finding faster, you can go ahead and contribute code to the existing problems' solutions, or you could contribute your own solutions as and when you solve them :)

Happy solving and contributing! :)

Rules for contribution - 

    Add your name and the number of problems you've contributed in the README.MD file below the existing content under "Contributors". Keep incrementing the number as and when you add more solutions. 
    
    Additionally, each solution should follow the existing pattern - num<problem_num_perProjectEulerArchives>.(py|ipynb)
