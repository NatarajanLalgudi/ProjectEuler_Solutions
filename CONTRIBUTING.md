So, so far this has been a solo effort and I will continue to add my solutions to this repo as and when I solve more problems on Project Euler. But if you have suggestions or different approaches (and God knows this repo could use them) to make the solution-finding faster, you can go ahead and contribute code to the existing problems' solutions, or you could contribute your own solutions as and when you solve them :)

Happy contributing! :)
